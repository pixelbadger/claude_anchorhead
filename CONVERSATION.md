You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none
of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to
rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes,
and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...


An interactive gothic by Michael S. Gentry

Release 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7


A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The user wants to start a new game of Anchorhead. According to the CLAUDE.md file, I should use `./scripts/new.sh` to start a fresh game. This will archive the current save (if it exists) and start fresh.

Let me execute that command.
</details>

_2026-01-23 19:27:43_

I'll start a new game of Anchorhead for you.

_2026-01-23 19:27:43_

**🎮 Command:** `./scripts/new.sh`

Perfect! The new game has started. I can see the opening sequence of Anchorhead - the atmospheric introduction where the protagonist (a young woman recently married to Michael) arrives in the coastal town of Anchorhead to inherit a mansion from distant relatives.

The game has started us at "Outside the Real Estate Office" - a grim little cul-de-sac. The old save has been archived.

Now I should acknowledge this to the user and be ready to start playing. According to the CLAUDE.md instructions, I should respond in character - as the protagonist with her voice - using:
1. Inner monologue (2-3 sentences in first person, present tense)
2. Command to execute

But actually, the user just asked me to start a new game. I've done that. I should confirm it's started and perhaps show them the opening, then wait for their direction. Or I could take the first action.

Let me just confirm the game has started and show them where we are.

Perfect! A new game of Anchorhead has begun. The previous save has been archived.

You're now standing outside the Real Estate Office in a grim little cul-de-sac. The opening scene sets the stage: you're a young woman newly married to Michael, recently arrived from Texas to claim an unexpected inheritance - a mansion from distant relatives neither of you knew. Michael has gone to handle university paperwork, and you're here to pick up the keys from the real estate agent.

**Current Location**: Outside the Real Estate Office (a narrow cul-de-sac)
- East: Real Estate agent's office
- West: Back toward center of town  
- Southeast: Narrow, garbage-choked alley

**Inventory**: Wedding ring, clothes, umbrella (open)

The rain is starting to come down harder. What would you like to do first?

The user wants me to play the game. According to CLAUDE.md, I should take on the role of the protagonist - a young woman recently married to Michael, uprooted from Texas, increasingly uneasy about this strange town and her husband's family legacy. 

My response format should be:
1. **Inner monologue** (2-3 sentences): First person, present tense, matching Gentry's gothic prose style - her subjective experience
2. **Command**: The action to take

I'm standing outside the real estate office. The obvious first action is to go inside and meet with the agent to get the keys. Let me enter the office.
</details>

_2026-01-23 19:28:18_

**Inner monologue**: The rain feels wrong somehow — too heavy, too cold, like the sky itself disapproves of my presence here. I pull my coat tighter and stare at the office door, feeling that familiar knot of anxiety. Best to get this over with quickly, before Michael returns and sees the doubt written all over my face.

**Command**: I'll enter the real estate office.

_2026-01-23 19:28:19_

**🎮 Command:** `./scripts/play.sh "east"`

It seems to be locked.

A sudden gust of wind blows a cold spray of rain into your face.

The door is locked. I need to explore the area more. Let me check what else I can do. Maybe I should look around first, or try the alley. Let me examine the area more carefully.
</details>

_2026-01-23 19:28:26_

**Inner monologue**: Of course it's locked. Nothing about this town wants to make things easy. The agent must be running late, or perhaps this is just how things work in Anchorhead — cold, unwelcoming, shut tight against strangers. I should look around more carefully before Michael gets back.

**Command**: Let me examine my surroundings more thoroughly.

The office is locked. There's an alley to the southeast that's mentioned as "garbage-choked". Maybe I can find another way in, or find the agent, or discover something useful. Let me explore the alley.
</details>

_2026-01-23 19:28:34_

**Inner monologue**: The alley beckons with its shadows and refuse — not inviting, but at least it's a direction, a choice to make while I wait in this forsaken little dead-end street. Something about the way the garbage is piled there suggests people use it, pass through it. Perhaps there's another entrance, or the agent went around back.

**Command**: I'll investigate the alley.

This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

Interesting! There's a transom window high up on the northern building's wall - that's likely the real estate office. The alley is a dead end with garbage cans. Maybe I can use the garbage cans to reach that window? Let me examine the window first.
</details>

_2026-01-23 19:28:42_

**Inner monologue**: A transom window, high above the filth and decay. The northern building must be the office — and that window might be my way in if the agent truly isn't coming. The thought of climbing through garbage to break into a building I'm supposed to have legitimate business with fills me with a weary kind of irony. This is what my life has become.

**Command**: Let me examine that transom window more closely.

_2026-01-23 19:28:43_

**🎮 Command:** `./scripts/play.sh "examine window"`

It's about eighteen inches wide and a foot tall, with hinges along the top that
allow it to swing out. It's currently closed.

The window is about 18 inches wide and a foot tall, hinged at the top to swing out, currently closed. I could potentially climb through it if I can reach it. Let me examine the garbage cans - they might be stackable or climbable.
</details>

_2026-01-23 19:28:50_

**Inner monologue**: Small, but wide enough for a desperate woman to squeeze through. If I can reach it. The garbage cans sit there like an invitation to indignity, but Michael will be back soon and I have nothing to show for this errand. Pride is a luxury I can't afford right now.

**Command**: Let me examine the garbage cans.

The metal garbage cans are stuffed to overflowing with slowly decomposing
refuse.

The garbage cans are described but I need to see if I can actually climb on them. Let me try to climb the cans to reach the window.
</details>

_2026-01-23 19:28:56_

**Inner monologue**: The stench of rot rises from those cans like a miasma, but they look sturdy enough. Metal, not plastic. They might hold my weight long enough to reach that window. I've come a thousand miles to this godforsaken town — what's a little garbage compared to that?

**Command**: I'll climb onto the garbage cans.

_2026-01-23 19:28:56_

**🎮 Command:** `./scripts/play.sh "climb cans"`


### 📖 Game Response

You clamber onto the wobbling garbage can, precariously balanced.
