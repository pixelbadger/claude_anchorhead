You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none
of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to
rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes,
and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...


An interactive gothic by Michael S. Gentry

(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)

Release 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7


A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The user wants me to:
1. Start a new game of Anchorhead
2. Play for 45 rounds

Looking at the CLAUDE.md file, I can see:
- To start a new game, I should use `./scripts/new.sh`
- To play commands, I should use `./scripts/play.sh "command"`
- The character I'm playing is a young woman recently married to Michael, increasingly uneasy about Anchorhead
- This is a Lovecraftian horror mystery game
- I should match the gothic, atmospheric prose style

The current state shows I'm in the Real Estate Office back room, but since the user wants to start a NEW game, I should use the new.sh script first.

Then I need to play 45 rounds. A "round" here likely means executing 45 commands. I should start by exploring the game, examining things, and progressing through the story.

Let me start by running the new.sh script, then begin playing commands. I should be thoughtful and immersive, matching the character's voice as described.
</details>

_2026-01-23 12:55:03_

I'll start a fresh game of Anchorhead and begin our journey into this unsettling New England town. Let me initialize a new game and then proceed with exploration.

<details><summary>💭 Thinking</summary>

Good, the game has started. Now I need to begin playing. Let me start with examining my surroundings and getting oriented. I'll begin with some basic exploration commands.

The game describes:
- I'm at a cul-de-sac
- Real estate office to the east
- Town center to the west
- Alley to the southeast
- It's raining

I should start by looking around, checking inventory, and then entering the real estate office as that's what the intro text suggests I'm here to do.

_2026-01-23 12:55:10_

Excellent! The game has started. Now let me begin exploring this grim New England town. I'll start with basic orientation and then proceed methodically.

The door has a glass front with the name of the real estate company -- Benson &

This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.

For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls
of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where
the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible
through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a
single word:



The machine beeps.

A brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, "Verlac" is the name of
this branch of Michael's family.

The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.


A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The office door is open.

As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

The obelisk measures about two feet square at its base, narrowing slightly as it
rises a good fifteen feet to a bluntly pointed tip. An iron ring is embedded in
the stone high up on one side, about two feet from the top. Dense, twisting
hieroglyphs cover all four sides of the obelisk, although they are too worn to
be read clearly.

The gentle creaking of hawsers and the hollow slap of water beneath the wooden
pier provide a faint counterpoint to the endless, rhythmic surging of the sea.
The fishing industry (like the paper industry) has all but died away in
Anchorhead; nonetheless there are still a few boats tied to the pier. A path
leads back through an opening in a chain-link fence to the northwest; otherwise,
it's just you and the ocean.

An old, discarded tin of fish oil sits at the end of the pier.
