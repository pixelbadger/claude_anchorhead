You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none
of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to
rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes,
and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...

A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

You rap on the glass sharply, peering through it into the dark room inside.
Nobody answers. Strange; you just talked to the real estate agent -- Miss
Benson, you think it was -- yesterday. She was going to meet you here.

This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.

Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted,
papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and
the file room lies east.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering
machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls
of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where
the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible
through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a
single word:



The machine beeps.

A brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, "Verlac" is the name of
this branch of Michael's family.

You can hear a fly buzzing around, right around your head.

the way most desks tend to get at the end of a busy day. A telephone sits on one
corner, next to a digital answering machine. There is a small drawer to one
side.

The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.


This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window. One of the garbage cans has been pushed up against the wall directly
underneath it.

The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.

As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted,
papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and
the file room lies east.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering
machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none
of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to
rain.

These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes,
and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...

A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

The door has a glass front with the name of the real estate company -- Benson &
Brackhurst -- stenciled across it. The blinds are drawn, the lights are off
inside, and no one appears to be home. Odd, since the agent knew you were coming
today.

You rap on the glass sharply, peering through it into the dark room inside.
Nobody answers. Strange; you just talked to the real estate agent -- Miss
Benson, you think it was -- yesterday. She was going to meet you here.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.

Hmm. You still can't quite reach, because the garbage can is too far away from

(closing the umbrella first)
It's a tight squeeze, but you just manage to wriggle through, dropping quietly
to the floor inside.


Peering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of filing
cabinets lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A window high up on the
south wall lets in a very faint illumination.

Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted,
papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and
the file room lies east.

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls
of strange-sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where
the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible
through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a
single word:



The machine beeps.

A brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, "Verlac" is the name of
this branch of Michael's family.

The top of the desk is littered with paperwork -- notes, messages, files, etc.;
the way most desks tend to get at the end of a busy day. A telephone sits on one
corner, next to a digital answering machine. There is a small drawer to one
side.
