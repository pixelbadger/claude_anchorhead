You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the
pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter
ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.

Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming
to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was
bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and
decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping
away of your entire home, your entire life...

Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a
thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move
into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even
Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none
of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to
rain.
***MORE***These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.

You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to
focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick
up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of
some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes,
and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.

A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder
-- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be
snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your
umbrella.

Welcome to Anchorhead...


An interactive gothic by Michael S. Gentry

(Type HELP or ABOUT for some useful information.)

Release 5 / Serial number 990206 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7


A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

>

You are wearing your wedding ring, your trenchcoat and your clothes; in
addition, you have in your hand your umbrella.

The pockets of your trenchcoat are empty.

>

I beg your pardon?

This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window.
